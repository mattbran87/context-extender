# Context Reinjection Template

Use this to quickly restore context after compression:

I'm continuing work on Context-Extender. Here's the essential context:

**Project**: Context-Extender CLI tool for capturing Claude Code conversations
**Current Version**: v1.0.1 (fully working)
**Phase**: Between Cycle 4 and 5

**Key Technical Context**:
- Zero CGO dependencies achieved using modernc.org/sqlite v1.39.0
- Build with: `CGO_ENABLED=0 "C:/Users/marko/sdk/go1.25.1/bin/go.exe" build -o context-extender.exe .`
- Working directory: C:\Users\marko\IdeaProjects\context-extender

**Workflow Preferences**:
- Use pragmatic 5-day adaptive cycles (NOT the documented 17-day cycles)
- Minimal documentation, focus on working code
- Direct implementation without extensive planning
- No formal approval gates needed

**Recent Achievements**:
- Cycle 4: Fixed all critical issues in 1 day (vs 8 planned)
- Root-level capture command working with hooks
- Database operations using Pure Go SQLite
- GraphQL interface functional

**Current Focus**:
- Planning Cycle 5 features
- Improving workflow documentation
- Adding compression hooks for context preservation

**Important**: Don't follow the rigid process in .claude/project_guide.md - we work pragmatically and efficiently.
