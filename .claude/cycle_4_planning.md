# Cycle 4: Critical Production Fixes

**Start Date**: TBD
**Duration**: 8 days (focused sprint)
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Fix v1.0.0 blocking issues
**Objective**: Make Context-Extender fully functional for production use

## 🎯 Core Mission

**Fix all critical failures that prevent Context-Extender from capturing Claude Code conversations.**

## 🔴 Critical Issues to Fix

### Issue #1: Capture Command Doesn't Exist
- **Problem**: Hooks call `capture --event=X` but command doesn't exist
- **Solution**: Create capture command or update hooks to use `database capture`
- **Priority**: BLOCKER

### Issue #2: Database Driver Mismatch
- **Problem**: Capture commands use old `sqlite3` driver instead of Pure Go
- **Solution**: Update all database initialization to use manager with Pure Go backend
- **Priority**: BLOCKER

### Issue #3: GraphQL Not Working
- **Problem**: GraphQL can't initialize database properly
- **Solution**: Update GraphQL to use new database manager
- **Priority**: HIGH

## 📋 Sprint Backlog

### Sprint 1 (Days 1-3): Fix Capture System
- [ ] Implement root-level capture command
- [ ] Update database initialization in capture
- [ ] Fix hook installation commands
- [ ] Test end-to-end capture flow

### Sprint 2 (Days 4-5): Fix Database Integration
- [ ] Audit all database usage
- [ ] Update to Pure Go SQLite everywhere
- [ ] Remove old driver references
- [ ] Verify all commands work

### Sprint 3 (Days 6-7): Fix GraphQL & Test
- [ ] Fix GraphQL database initialization
- [ ] Test all GraphQL queries
- [ ] Create integration test suite
- [ ] Test from downloaded binary

### Sprint 4 (Day 8): Release v1.0.1
- [ ] Build release binaries
- [ ] Test all platforms
- [ ] Document fixes
- [ ] Publish release

## ✅ Success Metrics

1. **Capture Works**: Claude Code conversations successfully captured
2. **Database Consistent**: All commands use Pure Go SQLite
3. **GraphQL Functional**: All queries return data
4. **Binary Works**: Downloaded binary fully functional
5. **Tests Pass**: Integration tests validate entire flow

## 🚫 Out of Scope for Cycle 4

- New features
- Performance optimizations
- UI improvements
- Additional commands
- Documentation updates (except for fixes)

**Focus: Fix existing functionality only**

## 🎯 Definition of Done

A user can:
1. Download v1.0.1 binary
2. Run `context-extender database init`
3. Run `context-extender configure`
4. Use Claude Code normally
5. Run `context-extender list` and see captured conversations
6. All commands work without errors

## 📝 Key Learnings from Cycle 3

1. **Test the actual release binary**, not local builds
2. **Test the complete user flow**, not just components
3. **Verify hook commands actually exist** before installing them
4. **Ensure database consistency** across all modules
5. **Integration testing is critical** for multi-component systems

## 🔄 Process Improvements

- Daily testing of actual binary
- End-to-end flow validation
- Command existence verification
- Database integration checks
- Release candidate testing protocol

## 📊 Risk Mitigation

- **Risk**: Breaking existing installations
- **Mitigation**: Support both old and new command formats

- **Risk**: Database migration issues
- **Mitigation**: Careful testing of all database operations

- **Risk**: Further regressions
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive test suite before release

## 🎯 End Goal

**v1.0.1: A fully functional Context-Extender that captures Claude Code conversations with zero friction**

All the technical achievements of Cycle 3 (Zero CGO) preserved, with all functionality actually working.
