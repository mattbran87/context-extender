## Estimation Models and Algorithms

### Story Point Estimation Model
```
Base Estimate = Historical Average × Complexity Factor × Skill Factor

Where:
- Historical Average = Average effort for similar stories
- Complexity Factor = Technical × Integration × Business complexity
- Skill Factor = Team expertise adjustment (0.8-1.2)

Risk Adjustment = Base Estimate × (1 + Risk Score × 0.1)
Final Estimate = Risk Adjustment + Buffer
```

### Capacity Planning Algorithm
```
Available Capacity = Working Days × Hours per Day × Focus Factor

Where:
- Working Days = 11 (Implementation phase)
- Hours per Day = 8 (standard)
- Focus Factor = 0.7-0.8 (accounting for meetings, context switching)

Effective Capacity = Available Capacity × Team Velocity Factor
Buffer Capacity = Effective Capacity × 0.15-0.20
```

### Resource Optimization Scoring
```
Match Score = Skill Match × Availability × Load Balance × Priority

Where:
- Skill Match = (Required Skills ∩ Available Skills) / Required Skills
- Availability = Available Hours / Required Hours
- Load Balance = 1 - (Resource Load Variance)
- Priority = Story Priority Weight
```
