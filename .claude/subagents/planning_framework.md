# Planning Phase Subagent Framework

## Overview
The context-extender project uses specialized planning phase subagents to automate story refinement, estimation, and implementation planning during the critical 3-day planning phase. These subagents complement the SME structure and integrate seamlessly with implementation phase subagents.

## Planning Subagent Structure

1. **Story Refinement Specialist** - Epic breakdown, INVEST validation, technical enrichment
2. **Implementation Planning Orchestrator** - Estimation, resource allocation, timeline creation

### ðŸŸ¡ Priority 2: Decision Support Enhancement  
3. **Architecture Decision Advisor** - Technical decision analysis and ADR generation (future)
4. **Acceptance Criteria Generator** - Automated criteria generation and validation (future)

### ðŸŸ¢ Priority 3: Process Optimization
5. **Planning Velocity Analyzer** - Planning metrics and continuous improvement (future)

## Conclusion

The planning phase subagent framework provides comprehensive automation and intelligence for the critical planning phase, ensuring high-quality, implementation-ready outputs while reducing manual overhead and improving accuracy. Combined with the implementation phase subagents, this creates an end-to-end intelligent development assistant ecosystem for the context-extender project.

The phased implementation approach allows for validation and refinement while delivering immediate value, ultimately transforming the planning phase from a manual, time-consuming process to an efficient, data-driven activity that sets up successful implementation execution.
