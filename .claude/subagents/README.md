# Implementation Phase Subagent Framework

## Overview
The context-extender project uses specialized implementation phase subagents to automate execution tasks, reduce cognitive load, and maintain quality during the critical 11-day implementation phase. These subagents complement our SME structure by handling routine execution while SMEs provide strategic guidance.

## Implementation Subagent Structure

### High Priority Subagents (Essential for Implementation)
1. **Test Automation Specialist** - Automated test generation, execution, and analysis
2. **Code Quality Enforcer** - Real-time quality checking and standards enforcement
3. **Integration Orchestrator** - Cross-component testing and compatibility validation

### Medium Priority Subagents (Process Enhancement)
4. **Progress Tracker and Reporter** - Automated progress tracking and reporting
5. **Knowledge Curator** - Implementation knowledge capture and documentation
