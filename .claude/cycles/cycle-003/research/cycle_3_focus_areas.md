# Cycle 3 Focus Areas - Production Deployment Readiness

**Cycle**: 3 (Production Deployment)
**Phase**: Research Phase
**Date**: September 18, 2025
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Database functionality must be fully operational before user distribution

---

## üéØ Primary Cycle 3 Objective

**Make the database integration fully functional and production-deployable for end users.**

Based on Cycle 2 testing validation findings, the core blocker preventing user distribution is the CGO compilation requirement that prevents users from building and running the new database features.

---

## üö® Critical Issues Identified in Cycle 2

### Issue 1: CGO Compilation Dependency ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**
**Problem**: Database features require C compiler for SQLite support
- Users cannot build from source without C compiler
- SQLite and SQLCipher dependencies need CGO_ENABLED=1
- Complex build requirements prevent adoption

**Impact**:
- ‚ùå Tool cannot be distributed to users in current state
- ‚ùå Testing requires specialized build environment
- ‚ùå Deployment complexity blocks adoption

**Evidence from Testing**:
```bash
# Build attempt failed with:
Error: missing go.sum entry for module providing package github.com/mutecomm/go-sqlcipher/v4
CGO compilation required but C compiler not available
```

### Issue 2: Binary Distribution Gap ‚ö†Ô∏è **HIGH**
**Problem**: No pre-built binaries available for end users
- Current binary is Cycle 1 version (lacks database commands)
- Users expect working tool without compilation
- Missing platform-specific binary distribution

**Impact**:
- ‚ùå Users receive non-functional tool
- ‚ùå Testing guide cannot be executed by testers
- ‚ùå Production readiness claims cannot be validated

### Issue 3: Dependency Management ‚ö†Ô∏è **MEDIUM**
**Problem**: SQLCipher version compatibility issues
- `github.com/mutecomm/go-sqlcipher/v4 v4.5.4` revision not found
- Dependency conflicts in go.mod/go.sum
- Version pinning needs refinement
