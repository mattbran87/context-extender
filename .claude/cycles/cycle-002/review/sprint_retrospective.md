## ⚡ **What Could Be Improved**

### **1. CGO Compilation Dependencies**
**Observation**: SQLite's CGO requirement created build complexity

**Evidence**:
- ⚠️ Cannot run full test suite without C compiler
- ⚠️ Build process more complex than pure Go
- ⚠️ Platform-specific build requirements

**Impact**: Testing limited to manual verification, deployment complexity increased

**Action Items**:
- 🔧 **Investigate**: Pure Go SQLite alternatives for development/testing
- 🔧 **Create**: Pre-built binaries for major platforms
- 🔧 **Document**: Clear build requirements and troubleshooting

**Priority**: Medium - Affects development workflow but not end users

### **2. Import File Format Assumptions**
**Observation**: Claude JSONL format was reverse-engineered, not documented

**Evidence**:
- ⚠️ Had to discover format through file examination
- ⚠️ May break if Claude changes their internal format
- ⚠️ Limited to observed entry types

**Impact**: Import feature could be fragile to Claude updates

**Action Items**:
- 🔧 **Research**: Investigate Claude's official export capabilities
- 🔧 **Build**: Flexible parser with graceful degradation
- 🔧 **Monitor**: Claude updates that might affect format

**Priority**: Medium - Core feature but alternative approaches exist

### **3. Error Handling Inconsistency**
**Observation**: Error handling varies between commands and modules

**Evidence**:
- ⚠️ Some commands use fatal exits, others return errors
- ⚠️ Error message formatting not standardized
- ⚠️ Stack traces sometimes exposed to users

**Impact**: Inconsistent user experience when errors occur

**Action Items**:
- 🔧 **Standardize**: Error handling patterns across all commands
- 🔧 **Create**: User-friendly error message templates
- 🔧 **Add**: Debug mode for detailed error information

**Priority**: Low - Functional but could be more polished

### **4. Performance Testing Gaps**
**Observation**: Limited large-scale performance testing due to CGO constraints

**Evidence**:
- ⚠️ Manual performance testing only
- ⚠️ No automated benchmarks in CI
- ⚠️ Limited testing with very large datasets (>100MB)

**Impact**: Performance characteristics under heavy load unknown

**Action Items**:
- 🔧 **Create**: Synthetic test data for performance validation
- 🔧 **Build**: Performance test suite that can run manually
- 🔧 **Establish**: Performance regression testing process

**Priority**: Low - Current performance exceeds targets, but monitoring needed

## 🔄 **Process Improvements**

### **1. Daily Progress Tracking**
**What Worked**: TodoWrite tool provided excellent progress visibility
**Enhancement**: Add time tracking to better understand estimation accuracy

**Implementation**:
- Track actual time spent per story/task
- Compare with initial estimates
- Refine estimation process for future sprints

### **2. Documentation as Code**
**What Worked**: Documentation created alongside implementation
**Enhancement**: Integrate documentation into CI/CD pipeline

**Implementation**:
- Auto-generate API documentation from code
- Validate documentation examples against actual implementation
- Create documentation review process

### **3. Feature Prioritization**
**What Worked**: Clear story priorities prevented scope creep
**Enhancement**: Add business value scoring to prioritization

**Implementation**:
- Score stories by user impact and technical value
- Use scoring to guide tough prioritization decisions
- Track actual business value delivery post-release
