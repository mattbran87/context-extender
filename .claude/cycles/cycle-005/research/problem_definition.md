# Problem Definition - Cycle 005

## Problem Statement
Context-Extender v1.0.1 has solid core functionality but needs enhanced integration and data management capabilities to provide maximum value to users.

## Research Areas
1. **Enhanced Hook Management**: Improve Claude Code hook installation, configuration, and management
2. **Export Capabilities**: Add comprehensive data export in JSON, CSV, and report formats
3. **Claude Commands**: Explore integration with Claude's command system and workflow enhancement

## Objectives
- Research current limitations in hook management
- Explore export formats and user needs for data analysis
- Investigate Claude commands and potential integrations
- Identify high-impact improvements for user experience

## Success Criteria
- Clear understanding of hook management pain points and solutions
- Defined export capabilities with specific formats and use cases
- Research on Claude commands and integration possibilities
- Actionable recommendations for implementation

## Constraints
- Maintain zero CGO dependencies
- Preserve Pure Go SQLite implementation
- Follow pragmatic development approach
- Build on existing v1.0.1 foundation
