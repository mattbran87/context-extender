# Cycle 4 Summary: Critical Fixes Sprint

## Overview
- **Duration**: 1 day (planned: 8 days)
- **Efficiency**: 800% faster than planned
- **Objective**: Fix all production blocking failures in v1.0.0
- **Status**: âœ… **MISSION ACCOMPLISHED**

## Problem Statement
v1.0.0 achieved zero CGO dependencies but had critical functional failures:
1. Capture commands didn't exist (hooks failed)
2. Database driver mismatch (capture used old driver)
3. GraphQL interface broken (database initialization failed)

## Solution Implemented
1. **Created root-level capture command** (`cmd/capture.go`)
2. **Fixed database driver consistency** (all commands use Pure Go manager)
3. **Restored GraphQL functionality** (dual initialization approach)

## Results
- **Integration Tests**: 10/10 passing
- **Release**: v1.0.1 successfully deployed
- **Primary Use Case**: Fully functional (captures Claude Code conversations)
- **Technical Goal**: Zero CGO dependencies maintained

## Key Files Modified
- `cmd/capture.go` - NEW: Root-level capture command
- `cmd/database.go` - Updated to use new manager consistently
- `cmd/graphql.go` - Fixed with dual initialization
- `tests/test_integration.go` - NEW: Comprehensive test suite

## Lessons Learned
1. Integration testing prevents production failures
2. Root commands needed for hook compatibility (not subcommands)
3. Backward compatibility sometimes requires dual approaches
4. Rapid iteration can be more effective than extended planning

## Cycle 4 Deliverables
Located in `.claude/cycles/cycle-004/`:
- `research/CYCLE_4_CRITICAL_FIXES.md` - Problem analysis and planning
- `review/CYCLE_4_SUCCESS.md` - Comprehensive success documentation
