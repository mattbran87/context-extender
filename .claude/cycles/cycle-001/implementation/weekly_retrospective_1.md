- **Quality Gates**: All code quality standards met consistently
- **User Integration**: Claude Code hooks working perfectly in live environment

## üîÑ What Could Be Improved

### Technical Areas
- **Initial Setup**: Could have discovered Go installation path earlier
- **Test Strategy**: Minor test path issues required adjustment (resolved quickly)

### Process Areas
- **Planning**: Story estimation was accurate, no major deviations
- **Communication**: Excellent progress tracking maintained throughout

## üö® Blockers and Resolutions

### Resolved This Week
- **Go Installation**: Discovered Go 1.25.1 in IntelliJ installation path
  - **Resolution**: Used full path to Go binary for development
  - **Impact**: Minimal, resolved within hours

- **Test Path Handling**: Test executable paths didn't match expected patterns
  - **Resolution**: Improved path comparison logic and test assertions
  - **Impact**: Tests now robust and comprehensive

## üìù Lessons Learned

### Technical Insights
- **Path Handling**: Cross-platform path comparison needs normalization and flexibility
- **Test Design**: Account for test executable paths being different from production
- **JSON Management**: Custom marshaling essential for preserving unknown fields
- **Hook Integration**: Claude Code hooks require absolute paths for reliability

### Process Insights
- **Real-time Documentation**: Mandatory documentation creation prevents knowledge loss
- **Quality First**: Comprehensive testing from start prevents technical debt
- **User Validation**: Live testing in actual Claude Code environment essential

## üéØ Focus for Next Week

### Priority Stories (Week 2)
- **Story CE-001-03**: Storage Directory Setup
- **Story CE-001-04**: Session Tracking
- **Story CE-001-05**: Context File Management
- **Story CE-001-06**: Basic Context Capture

### Quality Targets
- **Maintain**: 80%+ test coverage
- **Achieve**: Zero critical security issues
- **Complete**: 100% public API documentation
- **Deliver**: Cross-platform compatibility

### Risk Mitigation
- **File System Operations**: Plan for atomic file operations and error recovery
- **Context Size**: Monitor memory usage for large conversation contexts
- **Performance**: Establish benchmarks for context processing

## üîÆ Predictions for Success

### High Confidence
- **Foundation Quality**: Solid base established for remaining features
- **Process Maturity**: Documentation and quality practices proven effective
- **User Integration**: Claude Code integration working seamlessly

### Areas to Watch
- **Complexity Growth**: Context management features more complex than configuration
- **Performance**: File I/O patterns may need optimization
- **User Experience**: Context sharing workflow needs careful design
