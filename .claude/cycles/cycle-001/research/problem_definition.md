# Problem Definition - Context-Extender Project

**Date**: 2024-09-16
**Phase**: Research - Day 1
**Cycle**: 001

## Core Problem Statement

The user needs a CLI tool to manage a database of Claude Code conversations, enabling context sharing between different Claude sessions and maintaining conversation history across projects.

## User Requirements Analysis

### 1. Core Problem
- **Challenge**: Context window limitations and need to share context between Claude Code sessions
- **Current Pain**: Cannot access conversation data from previous sessions
- **Target Solution**: Automatic conversation capture with cross-session sharing capability

### 2. Success Criteria
- Access stored conversation data in any Claude Code session
- Automatic capture without manual intervention
- Cross-session context sharing capability

### 3. Primary Use Cases

#### Scenario 1: Cross-Session Debugging
- **Context**: User debugging Python app in Session A, running tests in Session B
- **Need**: Access test results and insights from Session B while in Session A
- **Value**: Informed debugging with full test context

#### Scenario 2: Pattern Sharing Across Projects
- **Context**: Multiple productive Claude conversations across 3 different projects using same language/framework
- **Need**: Share effective patterns and examples with new Claude session
- **Value**: Leverage previous learning and established patterns

#### Scenario 3: Multi-Session Coordination
- **Context**: 3 different Claude Code sessions with different starting prompts
- **Need**: Share work summaries to avoid duplication or conflicts
- **Value**: Coordinated development without repeated work

### 4. Technical Environment
- **Claude Code Version**: Latest (compatible with hooks system)
- **Primary OS**: Windows with cross-platform support requirement
- **Go Version**: No specific requirement (use latest stable)
- **Installation**: Simple, single-command installation preferred

### 5. Scope for Cycle 1 MVP
- CLI with automatic hook installation
- Capture user requests and Claude responses via hooks
- File-based storage (proof of concept)
- Basic conversation management commands
- Foundation for Cycle 2 database implementation

## Stakeholder Analysis

### Primary Stakeholder
- **Role**: Developer using Claude Code for multiple projects
- **Goals**: Efficient context sharing, conversation history access
- **Pain Points**: Context loss between sessions, repeated explanations
- **Success Metrics**: Reduced context re-establishment time, improved session productivity

### Technical Constraints
- Must integrate with Claude Code hooks system
- Cross-platform compatibility required
- Minimal performance impact on Claude Code
- Simple installation and configuration

## Value Proposition
"Automatically capture and manage Claude Code conversations to enable seamless context sharing between sessions, eliminating the need to re-establish context and enabling pattern reuse across projects."
