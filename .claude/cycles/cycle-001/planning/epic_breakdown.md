## Epic Summary

**Epic Name**: Context-Extender CLI Tool
**Epic Goal**: Automatically capture and manage Claude Code conversations to enable context sharing between sessions
**Business Value**: Eliminate context re-establishment overhead, enable pattern reuse across projects

## Epic Decomposition Rationale

### Original Epic Scope
The Context-Extender epic was initially conceived to include:
- Automatic conversation capture via Claude Code hooks
- Comprehensive conversation management (CRUD operations)
- Advanced search and filtering capabilities
- Multi-format export functionality
- Project-specific configuration controls
- Cross-session context sharing
- Real-time collaboration features

### Decomposition Strategy

#### Cycle 1 MVP Principle
**Decision**: Focus on core value proposition and technical foundation
**Rationale**: Deliver working context sharing capability quickly while establishing solid architecture for future expansion

#### Story Decomposition Approach
1. **User Journey Mapping**: Mapped primary user scenarios to identify minimum viable features
2. **Technical Dependency Analysis**: Identified foundational components required for all features
3. **Risk-Based Prioritization**: Prioritized highest-risk, highest-value features first
4. **Implementation Complexity Assessment**: Balanced feature value against development effort

## Story Prioritization Logic

### **High Priority (Core MVP)**
1. **Installation Stories** (CE-001-01, CE-001-02, CE-001-03)
   - **Rationale**: Nothing works without proper installation and setup
   - **Risk Mitigation**: Highest technical risk items (Claude Code integration)

2. **Capture Infrastructure** (CE-001-04, CE-001-05, CE-001-06)
   - **Rationale**: Core data collection and storage must be solid
   - **User Value**: Foundation for all conversation management

3. **Basic Management** (CE-001-07)
   - **Rationale**: Users need to see captured conversations to validate system works
   - **User Value**: Immediate feedback on capture functionality

4. **Context Sharing** (CE-001-10)
   - **Rationale**: Primary user value proposition - the "why" for the entire system
   - **User Value**: Solves the core problem statement

### **Medium Priority (Deferred)**
1. **Search Functionality** (CE-001-08)
   - **Rationale**: Valuable but complex, requires indexing strategy
   - **Deferral Reason**: Can manually review conversations in MVP

2. **Export Features** (CE-001-09)
   - **Rationale**: Useful for sharing but not core to context transfer
   - **Deferral Reason**: Context sharing provides primary sharing mechanism

3. **Advanced Validation** (CE-001-11)
   - **Rationale**: Nice-to-have quality improvement
   - **Deferral Reason**: Basic context sharing should work reliably first

4. **Project Controls** (CE-001-12)
   - **Rationale**: Privacy/control feature but not essential for MVP
   - **Deferral Reason**: Global capture acceptable for initial validation
