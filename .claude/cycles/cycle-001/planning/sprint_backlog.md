## Sprint Scope Management

### **Core Commitment (Must Have)**
Stories CE-001-01 through CE-001-07 and CE-001-10:
- **Foundation**: Installation, hooks, storage (13 points)
- **Core Value**: List conversations, context sharing (8 points)
- **Total**: 21 points (67% of sprint capacity)

### **Sprint Goals (Should Have)**
Story CE-001-06 and CE-001-13:
- **Enhancement**: JSON storage optimization (3 points)
- **Usability**: Basic configuration (2 points)
- **Total**: 5 points (16% of sprint capacity)

### **Stretch Goals (Could Have)**
Performance optimization and polish:
- **Buffer**: Quality improvements, bug fixes
- **Total**: 5 points (16% of sprint capacity)

### **Scope Adjustment Protocol**
If velocity is slower than expected:
1. **First**: Defer CE-001-13 (Basic Configuration) to Cycle 2
2. **Second**: Simplify CE-001-10 (Context Sharing) to basic functionality
3. **Last Resort**: Defer CE-001-06 (JSON Completed Storage) - keep JSONL only

## Risk Mitigation Plan

### **High-Risk Stories**
1. **CE-001-02 (Hook Configuration)** - 5 points
   - **Risk**: Claude Code integration complexity
   - **Mitigation**: Early prototype, SME consultation, fallback plan
   - **Contingency**: Manual configuration mode

2. **CE-001-04 (Session Correlation)** - 5 points
   - **Risk**: Concurrent session handling complexity
   - **Mitigation**: Simple UUID approach first, optimize later
   - **Contingency**: Single session support only

3. **CE-001-10 (Share Context Between Sessions)** - 5 points
   - **Risk**: Claude Code context import mechanism unclear
   - **Mitigation**: Research phase validation, early testing
   - **Contingency**: File-based context sharing

### **Dependency Risks**
- **Claude Code Changes**: Monitor for Claude Code updates during sprint
- **Go Package Issues**: Validate all dependencies early in sprint
- **Cross-Platform Issues**: Test on all platforms by mid-sprint
