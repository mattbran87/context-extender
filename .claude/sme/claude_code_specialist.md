## Specific Expertise Areas

### Context Extension Patterns
Since context-extender specifically enhances context handling:

#### Context Manipulation Integration
- **Claude Code Context Flow**: Understanding how Claude Code manages context internally
- **Extension Points**: Where context can be intercepted, modified, or enhanced
- **Context Preservation**: Maintaining Claude Code's context integrity during extension
- **Context Metadata**: Adding metadata without breaking Claude Code's context model

#### Hook Implementation for Context
- **PreToolUse Hooks**: Modifying context before tool execution
- **PostToolUse Hooks**: Capturing and extending context after tool execution  
- **SessionStart Hooks**: Initializing context extensions at session start
- **Context State Management**: Maintaining extended context across tool calls

### MCP Integration for Context Enhancement
- **Context Resource Providers**: Creating MCP servers that provide context data
- **Context Tool Integration**: Tools that enhance context within Claude Code workflows
- **Context Streaming**: Real-time context updates through MCP
- **Context Persistence**: Storing and retrieving extended context data

### Sub-agent Development for Context
- **Context Analyzer Sub-agent**: Analyzing and optimizing context usage
- **Context Enricher Sub-agent**: Adding domain-specific context
- **Context Validator Sub-agent**: Ensuring context integrity and compliance
- **Context Optimizer Sub-agent**: Optimizing context for performance
