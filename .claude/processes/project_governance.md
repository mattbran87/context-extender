# Project Governance Framework

## Overview
This document establishes the governance structure for the context-extender project, including decision-making frameworks, accountability models, and governance SME subagents that Claude can consult throughout the project lifecycle.

```

### Future State (Expanded Team)
```
Steering Committee
├── Project Sponsor
├── Technical Lead
├── Product Owner
└── Key Stakeholders
    ├── Technical Board
    ├── Security Board
    └── Quality Board
```

## Governance Processes

### Decision Making Process

graph TD
    A[Decision Required] --> B{Decision Type?}
    B -->|Strategic| C[User Decision]
    B -->|Technical| D[Claude Analysis]
    B -->|Operational| E[Claude Recommendation]
    D --> F[Present Options to User]
    E --> G{Critical?}
    F --> H[User Approval]
    G -->|Yes| H
    G -->|No| I[Claude Executes]
    C --> J[Document Decision]

```

### Escalation Matrix

| Issue Level | Response Time | Escalation To | Action Required |
|------------|---------------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Critical** | Immediate | User | Stop work, await decision |
| **High** | Within 4 hours | User | Complete current task, then address |
| **Medium** | Within 1 day | User (inform) | Address in next planning session |
| **Low** | Next cycle | Document only | Include in retrospective |

### Governance Gates

#### Phase Transition Gates
Each phase transition requires governance review:

**Gate Criteria Template**:
```markdown
## Phase Transition Gate: [Phase] → [Next Phase]

### Mandatory Criteria (Must Pass)
- [ ] All phase deliverables complete
- [ ] No critical risks unmitigated
- [ ] User approval obtained
- [ ] Documentation updated

### Quality Criteria (Should Pass)
- [ ] Test coverage meets standards
- [ ] Technical debt within limits
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Stakeholder feedback positive

### Decision
- **Pass**: Proceed to next phase
- **Conditional Pass**: Proceed with noted actions
- **Fail**: Remain in current phase, address gaps
```

## Governance Meetings

### Current State (Integrated into Workflow)
- **Strategic Review**: Start of each cycle (Research Day 1)
- **Technical Review**: Planning Day 2
- **Risk Review**: Planning Day 3
- **Quality Review**: Review Day 2
- **Process Review**: Review Day 3 (Retrospective)

### Future State (Formal Meetings)
- **Steering Committee**: Monthly
- **Technical Board**: Bi-weekly
- **Risk Committee**: Weekly during high-risk periods
- **Quality Board**: End of each cycle

## Governance Metrics

### Decision Metrics
- Decision turnaround time
- Decisions reversed/changed
- Escalation frequency
- Approval vs rejection ratio

### Process Metrics
- Gate passage rate (first attempt)
- Process compliance score
- Deviation requests
- Continuous improvement items implemented

### Quality Metrics
- Defect escape rate
- Rework percentage
- Technical debt ratio
- Documentation completeness

**Level 1: Ad-hoc** (Starting point)
- Informal decision-making
- Reactive governance
- Minimal documentation

**Level 2: Defined** (Current target)

- Integrated risk management

**Level 4: Optimized** (Long-term)
- Predictive governance
- Automated compliance
- Continuous optimization

### Improvement Process
1. Identify governance gaps during retrospectives
2. Propose improvements with expected benefits
3. Pilot improvements in next cycle
4. Measure effectiveness
5. Standardize successful improvements
