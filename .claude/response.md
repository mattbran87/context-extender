1. Are you satisfied with this architecture for Cycle 1?
    I think so. Please give me an explanation of the architecture
2. Storage location preference:
   - Windows: %APPDATA%\context-extender\
   - Mac/Linux: ~/.context-extender/
   - Is this acceptable?
     - Yes
3. Should we now proceed to Day 2 of Research Phase to:
   - Complete technical feasibility analysis
   - Identify any remaining risks
   - Prepare for Planning Phase transition?
     - After you have explained the architecture we can move on.
